The integration of large language models (LLMs) as health assistants could significantly impact society by enhancing healthcare accessibility, especially in underserved areas. These models can support healthcare professionals by providing quick access to medical information, assist in preliminary diagnoses, and reduce workloads. They offer personalized health advice and mental health support, and play a role in educating the public about health issues. 

Additionally, LLMs can help in public health monitoring and response, potentially reducing healthcare costs. However, this technology faces challenges in ensuring information accuracy, maintaining privacy, and addressing ethical implications. Furthermore, LLMs can improve with continued learning and help bridge language and cultural barriers in healthcare.


## ðŸ‘‰ Directions to download the repository and run the notebook 

This is for the Washington Bike Demand Prediction repository. But the same steps could be followed for this repository. 

1. You'll have to download and install Git which could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.

2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository. I would like to store it in the "Git Folder" location.

3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/68ec804a501be2c8861643e707166d33a5d0ccd2/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot%20(16).png" width = "600" />


4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link to the repository.

5. The link to the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be an HTML link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone HTML" where the HTML is replaced by the link to this repository. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/68ec804a501be2c8861643e707166d33a5d0ccd2/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot(17).png" width = "600" />

6. After successfully downloading the repository, there should be a folder with the name of the repository as can be seen below.

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/60b3eb7b600fef4bc619331ba5caf21e93b149ef/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot%20(19).png" width = "600" />

7. Once the repository is downloaded, go to the start button and search for "Anaconda Prompt" if you have anaconda installed. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/60b3eb7b600fef4bc619331ba5caf21e93b149ef/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot%20(20).png" width = "600" />

8. Later, open the Jupyter notebook by writing "Jupyter notebook" in the Anaconda prompt. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/60b3eb7b600fef4bc619331ba5caf21e93b149ef/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot(21).png" width = "600" />

9. Now the following would open with a list of directories. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/60b3eb7b600fef4bc619331ba5caf21e93b149ef/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot(22).png" width = "600" />

10. Search for the location where you have downloaded the repository. Be sure to open that folder. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/60b3eb7b600fef4bc619331ba5caf21e93b149ef/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot%20(12).png" width = "600" />

11. You might now run the .ipynb files present in the repository to open the notebook and the python code present in it. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/60b3eb7b600fef4bc619331ba5caf21e93b149ef/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot(13).png" width = "600" />

That's it, you should be able to read the code now. Thanks.
